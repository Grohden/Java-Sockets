# Java sockets app

A "simple" app using sockets API, it implements a basic museum "site", that allows a client to:

* Register in the site (why? dunno) 
* Remove the registry from the site
* See all the registered users
* See all the artworks in a list

# Build

Since the person who asked me to do this doesn't know how to build 
a program, read an README file or simple write anything but bad C code
i need to make simple instructions on how to build.

Here are the instructions:

First, compile the java files into class files: 
* `javac src\app\App.java -cp src\ -d build\`

Then generate an executable jar:
* `cd build`
* `jar cfvm sockets.jar manifest.txt app`

# Run

After the build, you can run the jar **on the build folder**  with:
* `java -jar sockets.jar`
